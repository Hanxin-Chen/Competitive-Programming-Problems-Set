# Competitive-Programming-Problems-Set（Codes）

This repository only contains codes I have programed for Competitive Programming.
Unfortunately, I did not backup the prompts, questions, and specifications.


The problems contain follwing catagories:
- Game Theory
- Number Theory
- Graph Theory
- Searching
- Sorting
- Mathematics
- Data Structures
- Computational geometry
- String Analysis

Most frequently used algorithms & data structures:
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- SPFA
- Binary Search
- KMP Algorithm
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithm
- Segment Tree
- Binary Indexed Tree
- Disjoint Set
- sieve of Eratosthenes
